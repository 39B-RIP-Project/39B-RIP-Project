    <p class = "article-text">An innocent button press. That’s all it takes. One misclick like that and your device is at risk. The computer executes the command, downloading a script in the background, setting the trap laid by the malevolent programmer. Mimicking an update dialogue, the hacker’s program installs itself on the device, sending all the information from your machine to himself. Over the course of a few weeks, you unintentionally supply the hacker with your passwords to social media, their banking information, and cell provider. When the programmer feels like it they can destroy your life by stealing your money, selling your information to a third party, disconnecting you from the internet by terminating your cellphone plan, impersonating you on social media ruining your personal relationships, getting you kicked out of your school or university. The hacker essentially owns you while you suffer through this personal apocalypse.
<br>As our lives revolve increasingly around the web and the act of wirelessly transmitting information, the importance of cybersecurity skyrockets. Cybersecurity is the system of practices and machines put into effect with the intention of protecting programs and data from unauthorized access (Homeland Security). This means that we have a structure and plan designed to protect us citizens from these terrifying hackers, and for the most part it works well. A person cannot hack into a device that you don’t use on a regular basis, and our computers wouldn’t install viruses or bots on their own. However, we as people have complete control over our devices, thus we can install the bad programs on our computer if a programmer would be so devious to trick us. That is the goal of a hacker today: to trick the user of a device to press a button that they shouldn’t have. They could promise the user of the device anything: money, other electronics, the software or program they were searching for. Their entire goal depends on you pressing the wrong button and social engineering takes care of the rest.</p>
