      <p class = "article-text">An innocent button press. That’s all it takes. One misclick like that and your device is at risk. The computer executes the command, downloading a script in the background, setting the trap laid by the malevolent programmer. Mimicking an update dialogue, the hacker’s program installs itself on the device, sending all the information from your machine to himself. Over the course of a few weeks, you unintentionally supply the hacker with your passwords to social media, their banking information, and cell provider. When the programmer feels like it they can destroy your life by stealing your money, selling your information to a third party, disconnecting you from the internet by terminating your cellphone plan, impersonating you on social media ruining your personal relationships, getting you kicked out of your school or university. The hacker essentially owns you while you suffer through this personal apocalypse.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">As our lives revolve increasingly around the web and the act of wirelessly transmitting information, the importance of cybersecurity skyrockets. Cybersecurity is the system of practices and machines put into effect with the intention of protecting programs and data from unauthorized access (Homeland Security). This means that we have a structure and plan designed to protect us citizens from these terrifying hackers, and for the most part it works well. A person cannot hack into a device that you don’t use on a regular basis, and our computers wouldn’t install viruses or bots on their own. However, we as people have complete control over our devices, thus we can install the bad programs on our computer if a programmer would be so devious to trick us. That is the goal of a hacker today: to trick the user of a device to press a button that they shouldn’t have. They could promise the user of the device anything: money, other electronics, the software or program they were searching for. Their entire goal depends on you pressing the wrong button and social engineering takes care of the rest.<br></p>

    <h1 align="center">So someone gets into my computer … What could go wrong?</h1>

      <IMG SRC="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/7c/7cc29a92ee3024c3732febf291950706ff2f48ef889bc41999da34568d991fff.jpg" alt="meme blocked" style="width: 25%" align="left"/>
      <p class = "article-text">If you were to click on an unfortunate link, you would download an executable script. This script wants to run and install the rest of the program on your computer, but for a program to make significant changes to your machine, it requires permission and access granted by a person: preferably you, the user. It will prompt a window in your computer asking you for permission to run and reach its dirty electronic tentacles deeper into your device, but here again it would need to trick you again. The hacker would program his script to appear as an update bubble or prompt for an entirely different application. The prompt might appear as an update for your web browser, email, or operating system. You will not be able to tell the difference this time between which is a valid update bubble and which is a malicious program trying to install itself on your device. Without extra care, you would unknowingly give the program the permissions it needs.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">When the hacker’s program is fully set up on your device, their program will begin start collecting your data from the machine: every image that is displayed on the screen is recorded by the hacker’s code, every image that the camera in your machine captures is also recorded, every sound that the machine’s microphone picks up is also picked up, every key that you press on the machine is also recorded. The hacker’s program takes all this data, encrypts it, and sends it to a remote server to analyze later. By encrypting the information, the hacker cannot be traced as the one who stole your information. With all this data collected, the hacker will know who you’ve been around through the conversations through the microphone. They will know where you have been through the images picked up through your camera. They will know which sites you have visited and all your passwords for each one by parsing through all the keystrokes entered into your machine and its display. They will have more information about you than you yourself, and with this knowledge, they can start impersonating you.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">With all your passwords, they can lock you out of all your social media accounts. Send messages as you and talk to your peers as you. They can ruin all your relationships or simply delete all data you put up. They can start fights on your behalf suspending or even eliminating you from your school or job. They can use your banking information to make orders or cancel purchases in your name. They can terminate your rent or mortgage, evicting you from your home. Terminate cell phone and internet plans to stop you from communicating with others. Without money, shelter, companions, or the ability to communicate to people through phone or the internet, your world would end: a 21st century apocalypse, complete in nature and depressingly solitary.<br></p>

    <h1 align="center">How the hell does this happen?</h1>

      <p class = "article-text">As the creator of this website, I had the power to do that. I could have attached a link to the button prompting a file download instead of displaying this article, and there is no organization to stop me from doing so. We live in a day and an age where the internet and virtual devices are far and plenty. Each individual life has been represented in one of these electrical devices. From the monetary assets each person owns to their very address and physical information, our entire lives reside in these machines. Due to our dependence on these devices, one can argue that our society has already become cyborgs, literally for some of us and figuratively for all of us. Without these devices, we can no longer function in society. Thus, due to our dependence on technology, we often take many online practices for granted, but this field has grown so quickly that the bureaucracy hasn’t fully followed through with it. Most online practices have been created on a whim and are justified only by convention. No decent programmer tricks the visitor of a website to download malicious software because the act is frowned upon. There is no police or figure of authority to monitor these behaviors, only common human nature and compassion of some individuals keep these actions in check because the bureaucracy simply cannot keep up with the speed of the world-wide web.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">Take, for example, the case of internet piracy, the illegal practice of sharing and distributing copyrighted material over the web without the consent of the owner. A study completed in the UK regarding internet piracy and media, displayed disappointing results, “blocks have been ineffective in reducing torrenting” (5). To prevent the act from occurring, the government had blocked a few illegal websites from public access. This in turn decreased the popularity of the site; however, due to the ban, more sites began popping up as people created backups to illegally download software. The government continued to spend more money, but could not ban every torrenting website concluding that such a practice would be ineffective and useless due to the results of the initial run. They could block the large distributors like bitTorrent; however, there were always a group of people who would share the links with each other generating a web of interconnectivity across the web. Like the field of torrenting, internet hackers to act far too quickly to be stopped by government forces. If the government blocks one of their sites, they open a new one. They hide their physical location through other types of software to make themselves difficult to physically find. Laws and regulations are very difficult to uphold on the internet.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">Hackers are not computer wizards who have spent most of their lives according digital devices. With the power of the internet, anyone committed enough can learn the skills in less than a month. Per a study done by researchers in MIT regarding the mindset of an internet hacker, 40 percent of the people who hacked their internet survey to benefit from free gift cards had no prior experience in IT learning everything they knew in a matter of a few days. Anyone could become a dangerous hacker given the proper motivation. In this case study, the motivation was a few gift card vouchers, and some students were still desperate enough to abuse the online system. Granted this case study was not as intense as a few people trying to ruin the lives of other by stealing all their information, but the intent is made apparent. With the advent of more technology, this horrendous becomes easier for a new person to pick up. Take for example, the USB rubber ducky which condenses this massive hacking operation into a device the size of your thumb. By simply plugging the USB into a computer, the script is unleashed with almost no programming required to set up the device. Both the technology and the mindset is present, anyone with $40 in their pocket can go and become a hacker and ruin the lives of an unfortunate few.<br></p>

    <h1 align="center">How to fight back</h1>
    <p>
      <IMG SRC="http://www.ferrygouw.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/OhNo-web1.jpg" alt="meme blocked" style="width: 27%" align="left"/>
      <p class = "article-text">Do not go and purchase a USB rubber ducky to try to ‘outhack’ the hackers. If the person whose life you are attempting to ruin is more tech savvy than you, a bigger target will be placed on your back and the attempt would be futile. Hackers set traps on the internet and wait for an alarm to come in that an unfortunate user fell into their trap. Thus, if you can avoid the traps or not get ensnared in one by granting the hacker’s code its permissions, your data will be secure.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">The biggest weapon against this apocalyptic action has been given to you, knowledge of the event. Knowing how the attack works prevents most of them. This whole destructive operation balances precariously under the assumption that the user clicks the hacker’s link. The hacker will go above and beyond to try to get the user to press the button making fake promises of free money, required software, or complementary goods. On the homepage of this website, I included three items to prompt the user to click on them; however, each one was secretly a link leading to this page. One was an obvious link with its blue underlined text, yet the others were a error bubble and a free book download button. When you mouse over these ‘links’ your cursor changes from an arrow to a hand, so if that happens the mouse hovers over a link. Unless you know what the link forwards you to, don’t click it.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">Even if you did accidentally press a malicious link, the cyber-assault can still be halted. Checking which permissions, you give an application and checking your downloads folder periodically to ensure you didn’t accidentally download something you didn’t want to, deleting the file if you don’t recognize it, stops the attack in its track. Being wary of updates to either your device or any other app checking to make sure that the request is indeed coming from the application you expect it to come from. Clearing your computer from unwanted files at the end of each month helps not only keep your information secure, but your device in phenomenal condition. If you are still extremely paranoid, change your passwords every season and make them different for each site never reusing the same ones. If you have trouble remembering them store a text file of them in a personal USB you’d carry everywhere, not on your computer. Following these steps would ensure your virtual world would be as secure as possible.<br></p>
      <p class = "article-text">Another redeeming factor is that there is not a single hacker who wants to do this to everybody in the world. Most of the hackers who contain this skill work as security managers for massive corporations and work to prevent attacks such as these, creating policies and preventive software. If a programmer can gain and learn this skill they probably would get a programming job, and would most likely earn money through this secure and stable fashion. Such a personal attack would likely be perpetrated by a personal enemy, so the only hackers to worry about would be any programmer enemies you made. Just another reason to be nice to everyone in this interconnected world we live in.<br></p>
