            //document.getElementById("article").innerHTML = "We live in a day and an age where the internet and virtual devices are far and plenty. Each individual life has been represented in one of these electrical devices. From the monetary assets each person owns to their very address and physical information, our entire lives reside in these machines. Due to our dependence on these devices, one can argue that our society has already become cyborgs, literally for some of us and figuratively for all of us. Without these devices, we can no longer function in society. Thus, due to our dependence on technology, we often take many online practices for granted, but the truth is this field has grown so quickly that the bureaucracy hasn’t fully followed through with it. Most online practices have been created on a whim and are justified only by convention. No decent programmer tricks the visitor of a website to download malicious software because the act is frowned upon in the past. There is no police or figure of authority to monitor these behaviors, only common human nature and compassion of some individuals keep these actions in check.\n\tIf one were to inflict serious harm and destroy this device which keeps the world connected, it would be a 21st century apocalypse. People would lose all money in their banks. People would lose all their online contacts. They wouldn’t be able to have any history of their life, any representation of self to justify arguments other than logic. People would riot in anger, at their lost resources which they foolishly converted to bits of electricity, and fear, at the possibility of never being able to return to this golden age of living. The world and society as we know it would end.\n\tFortunately, due to the interconnectivity of the internet, if there exists power, this system cannot die. As every online device is connected to one another each keeps the other in the loop and in check. Even if the handlers (google/web browsers) which connect devices to another break, they can still connect to each other using more primitive methods keeping the virtual net between the computers alive. This creation is the closest thing our race has created to immortality. Take the act of internet torrenting, downloading software without the creator’s permission, for example. The practice has been deemed illegal and shut down by the government; however, they can never truly end the practice due to the way the internet works. They ban the handlers such as thepiratebay.se or bittorrent which pair computers together from across the world and allow file sharing in which a person can share any form of application with another person. A person can setup another website to allow sharing of the copyrighted material or owners of the banned apps can still them use them between each other. A single group or entity cannot destroy the creation which is the internet due to the principle of the object, to connect every machine to one another. It puts itself back together faster than one can take it down. However, they can break small sections of it.\n\tIndividual devices are much easier to track and destroy using the internet. When everything is connected to one another, it is very simple to target a single device on this network and ruin or corrupt it. When we download malware (dangerous software), sometimes it renders our device useless. We are left with a glorified paperweight essentially, but this is the best possible outcome from a cyber-attack. Rather than destroying a device, hackers today love to take control of it and gain access to many nefarious tactics. With control of a device such as a computer you are using to view this work, a hacker can view every file in the computer: all the items written in word or memos, all images and videos on your device, every application you’ve downloaded. They can monitor any input you could put into your device: the feed from your camera, the keystrokes or mouse clicks you make, your browser history. This information has horrifying results as a person who has hacked (gained remote access) of your device can destroy your life. We are so dependent on these machines that if someone gained access to a machine that we owned they would gain access to all our: contacts, bank statements, passwords to websites, private information. They would gain your information by monitoring your activities while using your devices and track certain passwords you input at specific sites. They could write emails as you, terminate your cell phone plans, steal all your money, and gain information about your family and friends (so they could repeat the process on them) all by hacking your device. Your life would literally be over, relationships broken and no assets to your name, a personal apocalypse (collapsing of your own world). The most frightening part about the entire experience is how simple it is to be hacked.\n\tA push of a button. That’s all it takes for the process to be initiated. The software would be downloaded on the device, but then it needs admin privileges (control to write code to the device) to unleash its horrendous tentacles. This is where a lack of software bureaucracy comes into play. It is common practice to allow our devices to update when the dialog shows up. It is an unwritten rule that software asks for admin privileges in a specific, loud way to jerk the user into attention and think about what they are entailing the device to do. Software updates are written in a specific way, subtler than these to not disturb the user, but remind them to complete this task later. These updates require admin privileges to execute as well, so if a software asked the user for its privileges like a software update, most users won’t even think twice and click the button expecting to update their device. The malware has now been fully initialized in their device and now the hacker has complete control of both the life of the device and the user.\n\tThere is light at the end of this tunnel, again. Not every download or link on a website would entail such a horrendous fate, very few would and for the public it shouldn’t matter. The biggest weapon against this destruction of a person has been given to the reader, knowledge of the event. Knowing how the attack works prevents most of them. Checking which permissions, you give an app and checking your downloads folder periodically to ensure you didn’t accidentally download something you didn’t want to (deleting the file if you don’t recognize it) stops the attack in its track. Being wary of updates to either your device or any other app checking to make sure that the request is indeed coming from the application you expect it to come from. Clearing your computer from unwanted files at the end of each month helps not only keep your information secure, but your device in phenomenal condition. If you are still extremely paranoid, change your passwords every season and make them different for each site never reusing the same ones (if you suck at remembering them store a text file of them in a personal USB you’d carry everywhere, not on your computer). Following these steps would ensure your virtual world would be as secure as possible.\n\tAnother redeeming factor is that there is not a single hacker who wants to do this to everybody in the world (You only need to ruin the lives of a few people to make yourself enough to live by, ask your parents they should know <- joke). Most of the hackers who contain this skill work as security managers for massive corporations and work to prevent attacks such as these, creating policies and preventive software. If a programmer can gain and learn this skill they probably would get a programming job, and would most likely gain money that way instead through the much more secure fashion. Such a personal attack would likely be perpetrated by a personal enemy, so the only hackers to worry about would be any programmer enemies you made. This is just another reason to be nice to everyone in this interconnected world we live in.\n\t";
